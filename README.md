**Warning**: this code is very much a work in progress and is primarily being intended for a particular workflow. It may not work well (or at all)Â for your workflow.

`hugit` is a command line tool for loading ImageFolder style datasets into a ðŸ¤— `datasets` `Dataset` and pushing to the ðŸ¤— hub.

The primary goal of `hugit` is to help quickly get a local dataset into a format that can be used for training computer vision models. `hugit` was developed to support the workflow for [`flyswot`](https://github.com/davanstrien/flyswot/) where we wanted a quicker iteration between creating new training data, training a model, and using the new model inside [`flyswot`](https://github.com/davanstrien/flyswot/).

## Supported formats

At the moment **hugit** supports ImageFolder style datasets i.e:

```bash
data/
    dog/
        dog1.jpg
    cat/
        cat.1.jpg

```

## Features

- A command line interface for quickly loading a dataset stored on disk into a ðŸ¤— `datasets.Dataset`
- Push your local dataset to the ðŸ¤— hub
- Get statistics about your dataset. These statistics focus on 'high level' statistic that would be useful to include in Datasheets and Model Cards. Currently these statistics include:
  - label frequencies, organised by split
  - train, test, valid split sizes

## Installation

You can install _Hugit_ via [pip] from [PyPI], inside a virtual environment install `hugit` using

```console
$ pip install hugit
```

Alternatively, you can use [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) to install `hugit`

```console
$ pipx install hugit
```

## Usage

You can see help for `hugit` using `hugit --help`

<!-- [[[cog
import cog
from hugit import cli
from click.testing import CliRunner
runner = CliRunner()
result = runner.invoke(cli.cli, ["--help"])
help = result.output.replace("Usage: cli", "Usage: hugit")
cog.out(
    "```\n{}\n```".format(help)
)
]]] -->

```
Usage: hugit [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Hugit Command Line

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  push_image_dataset  Load an ImageFolder style dataset.

```

<!-- [[[end]]] -->

To load an ImageFolder style dataset onto the ðŸ¤— Hub you can use the `push_image_dataset` command.

<!-- [[[cog
import cog
from hugit import cli
from click.testing import CliRunner
runner = CliRunner()
result = runner.invoke(cli.cli, ["push_image_dataset", "--help"])
help = result.output.replace("Usage: cli", "Usage: hugit")
cog.out(
    "```\n{}\n```".format(help)
)
]]] -->

```
Usage: hugit push_image_dataset [OPTIONS] DIRECTORY

  Load an ImageFolder style dataset.

Options:
  --repo-id TEXT                  Repo id for the Hugging Face Hub  [required]
  --private / --no-private        Whether to keep dataset private on the Hub
                                  [default: private]
  --do-resize / --no-do-resize    Whether to resize images before upload
                                  [default: do-resize]
  --size INTEGER                  Size to resize image. This will be used on the
                                  shortest side of the image i.e. the aspect
                                  rato will be maintained  [default: 224]
  --preserve-file-path / --no-preserve-file-path
                                  preserve_orginal_file_path  [default:
                                  preserve-file-path]
  --help                          Show this message and exit.

Under the hood `hugit` uses [`typed-settings`](https://typed-settings.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), which means that configuration can either be done through the command line or through a `TOML` file. See [usage] for more detailed discussion of how to use `hugit`.
