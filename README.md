`hugit` is a command line tool for loading ImageFolder style datasets into a ðŸ¤— `datasets` `Dataset` and pushing to the ðŸ¤— hub.

The primary goal of `hugit` is to help quickly get a local dataset into a format that can be used for training computer vision models. `hugit` was developed to support the workflow for [`flyswot`](https://github.com/davanstrien/flyswot/) where we wanted a quicker iteration between creating new training data, training a model, and using the new model inside [`flyswot`](https://github.com/davanstrien/flyswot/).

## Supported formats

At the moment ImageFolder style datasets i.e:

```bash
data/
    dog/
        dog1.jpg
    cat/
        cat.1.jpg

```

## Features

- A command line interface for quickly loading a dataset stored on disk into a ðŸ¤— `datasets.Dataset`
- Push your local dataset to the ðŸ¤— hub
- Get statistics about your dataset. These statistics focus on 'high level' statistic that would be useful to include in Datasheets and Model Cards. Currently these statistics include:
  - label frequencies, organised by split
  - train, test, valid split sizes

## Installation

You can install _Hugit_ via [pip] from [PyPI], since it's a command-line application [`pipx`](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) is highly recommended:

```console
$ pipx install hugit
```

help = result.output.replace("Usage: cli", "Usage: hugit")
cog.out(
    "```\n{}\n```".format(help)
)
]]] -->

  Load an image dataset
